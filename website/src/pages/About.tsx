        <p className = "page-p color-darkpurple"> Harmony Hacks was inspired by the sense of community experienced during a women’s hackathon held at CSUSM. The event demonstrated the importance of creating inclusive environments in the tech industry and sparked a collective effort to expand these opportunities for others. With support from faculty advisors Youwen Ouyang and Jing Hou, the founding team began planning a hackathon designed for high school students—providing college students with a platform to gain mentorship experience and build professional connections. This initiative led to the official launch of Harmony Hacks in Fall 2024.

        <p className = "page-p color-white"> Harmony Hacks was founded by a group of seven driven women brought together by Dr. Ouyang and Dr. Hou, who shared a vision to increase the representation of women in computing. United by a shared passion for creating meaningful change, the founding members laid the foundation for a community centered on <span className = "bold">leadership, connection, and inclusivity</span>.
        </p>
        <p className = "page-p color-white"> The founding team collaborated to define the club’s identity — developing its mission, designing impactful events, and laying the groundwork for a supportive and empowering environment for women in tech. Through collaboration, creativity, and perseverance, they transformed an idea into a thriving community.

        <p className = "page-p color-white"> What started as a small initiative has grown into a vibrant community where young women are supported, inspired, and empowered to lead in the world of technology.
