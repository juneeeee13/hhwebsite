                <p className = "page-p color-darkpurple"> The music featured on this website was created by high school women who participated in previous Harmony Hackathons. These compositions are more than just melodies; They are encrypted messages coded in Python via Tunepad, a programming music tool. Each piece is a creative expression of empowerment, resilience, and innovation, encoded with powerful phrases such as:
                </p>
                <p className = "page-p color-darkpurple"> “Girls who innovate, inspire the future. Girls who create, transform the world. Girls who connect, empower one another.” — and much more!
                </p>
                <p className = "page-p color-darkpurple"> Drawing inspiration from Dr. Merryl Goldberg’s real-life story of using music to encrypt secret messages during the Cold War, high school participants did the same! These musical works are a lasting tribute to the voices of young women in tech that Harmony Hacks seeks to amplify, inspire, and celebrate!
